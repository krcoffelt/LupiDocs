# Lupi Docs & Designs — Lean Build Plan (Design-First)

## Goals
- Present a calm, boutique publishing partner with a single primary CTA: “Book a Consult.”
- Show credibility fast: who we are, what we do, a glimpse of work, how it happens.
- Keep the page light, scannable, and mobile-ready.

## Page Structure (one-page MVP)
1) **Hero** — Value prop, primary CTA, one supporting CTA (checklist). Minimal text, strong visual.
2) **Services (3 tiles)** — Manuscript & Positioning, Design & Production, Launch Support. One line each, CTA to contact.
3) **Portfolio glimpse** — 3 book cover slots (replace with real covers). Link to request more samples.
4) **Process (3 steps)** — Align → Build → Launch. One line each.
5) **About** — Founder-led note on Christine; why boutique.
6) **Checklist CTA** — Email capture hook (or link to form).
7) **Contact** — Short form + email/phone. Repeat primary CTA.

## Visual Direction
- Palette: Primary blue `#0047AB` on light background; minimal accents. Generous white space.
- Type: Serif for headings (Playfair) + clean sans (Manrope). Large, clear hero; tight body copy.
- Components: Simple cards/tiles, pills for proof points, soft shadows, rounded corners.
- Imagery: Book cover mock slots; founder badge; avoid clutter.

## Build Order
1) Hero + Header (sticky, CTA).
2) Service tiles.
3) Portfolio row (placeholders).
4) Process steps.
5) About card.
6) Checklist CTA.
7) Contact form + footer.

## Content Needs
- Confirm contact email/phone.
- Swap in real covers/titles and any approved testimonials/logos.
- Link/asset for checklist and scheduling (Calendly) if used.

## Success Criteria
- Mobile-friendly, fast load, obvious CTA.
- Clear hierarchy: hero → services → work → process → contact.
- No unverified stats; only approved proof elements.***
